# Performing Gradient Descent for Optimization

This folder contains Python code to demonstrate gradient descent optimization for various functions. Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning and numerical optimization to find the minimum of a function.

## Problems

The code in this folder provides solutions to the following optimization problems:

### Problem 1

Minimize the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 8. This problem is optimized using 1D gradient descent.

### Problem 2

Minimize the function f(x, y) = x^4 - 16x^3 + 96x^2 - 256x + y^2 - 4y + 262. This problem is optimized using 2D gradient descent.

### Problem 3

Minimize the function f(x, y) = exp(-(x - y)^2) * sin(y). This problem is also optimized using 2D gradient descent.

### Problem 4

Minimize the function f(x) = cos(x)^4 - sin(x)^3 - 4sin(x)^2 + cos(x) + 1. This problem is optimized using 1D gradient descent.

## Results

The code outputs the optimal values and displays the optimization path as an animation or saves them as images. You can find the animation and image files in the report.
