# Predicting Admission into a Top University

- Predicting the chance of admission into a prestigious university by linear regression.
- This used a dataset from kaggle.com that is supposed to predict a student's chance of admission to a University based on various parameters.
- Since the dataset is completely anonymized it is not clear whether it is based on real data, and anyway some of the parameters such as LoR, SoP etc are not even objectively measurable.
